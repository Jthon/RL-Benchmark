# RL-Benchmark
Implemention of several benchmark reinforcement learning algorithm
### Vanilla Policy Gradient
VPG is a simple policy gradient algorithm,in this repo, I trained the model in both discrete 
action space enviroment(CartPole-V1,LunarLander-v2) and continuous action space(not implemented yet). <br>
